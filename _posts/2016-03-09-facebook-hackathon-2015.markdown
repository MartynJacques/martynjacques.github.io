In April 2015 me and [my good friend](http://todddavies.co.uk) found ourselves
on a high speed train taking us from Manchester down to London for a long,
sleepless weekend of coding courtesy of Facebook.

To secure a ticket for the event we had to complete a coding challenge which
would be ran against a set of automated tests and reviewed by a Facebook
Engineer. I'm not sure on the accurate numbers but the previous year around
600 people applied, with around 100 getting through. Fortunately we were both
successful and passed the challenge.

On the way down we decided to make good use of our two hour train journey
so we brain stormed ideas and researched a couple of frameworks and
technologies. We had a few ideas ranging from wackey VR applications to a
number of web projects but in the end we decided on a web app which would show
users how many mentions their website is getting on various social media
platforms over time, thus showing the popularity (or lack of). We also wanted
to visualise the locations of these mentions on a world map to show the sites
'journey' around the globe. It was a cool idea, and we were confident that we
would produce a pretty polished version to present as required at the end of the
Hackathon.

In terms of technology used, we wanted something lightweight and easy to jump
right into. We decided on Flask as we both had experience with Python but
Django was too heavy. Both of us had experience using MySQL so that seemed
the best bet for the database (although on reflection I wouldn't go with this
anymore, I might write a post about that, stay tuned!). As we are both students
we were able to make most of the GitHub student pack which gives us a decent
lump of credit for the cloud hosting service DigitalOcean. This is what we used
for hosting. Throw all this in with Git and we were good to go.

As well as doing as well as we possibly could on the technical side of things
we wanted to make the most of our time in the Facebook offices. The offices were
pretty cool with an abundance of things to do such as play table tennis,
table football, video games and there was even a bouldering wall. In addition
to this the food and snacks were ace.

To save going into every detail feel free to scope out our final product
[here](https://github.com/MartynJacques/FacebookHackathon2015).
As with most, if not all software projects we encountered a number of issues
along the way, but that's the fun of it. It was a great learning
experience and the people we met there were ace. Our final presentation went
smoothly and the judges commented that our idea had great potential. When it
came to the competition there were some amazing creations. I'd like to give a
shout out to the winners, their product was brilliant and definitely had the
biggest business potential (one of Facebook's most important criteria for the
Hackathon), and they were worthy winners - congrats!

I'd like to thank everyone at Facebook who made this happen, it was a great
weekend!
