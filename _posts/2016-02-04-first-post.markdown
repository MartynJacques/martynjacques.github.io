Hi!

After taking some time to consider whether or not to embark on this mini-project
and after a bit of persuasion from a colleague of mine here is my first blog
post.

I have created this blog to extend my portfolio, write about stuff
I'm working on and to have something to look back on as the years go by.
Most of my posts will be tech related, but I may go off topic
once in a while. It also allows me to experiment with static site generators,
currently I'm using out of the box Jekyll (hosted using GitHub Pages) but I'm
willing to play around so expect things to change every so often.

As I go into my final year of University I'll be embarking on my third year
project titled 'Emotion Detection Using Facial Recognition' so I also plan to
use this blog as a journal to document my progress.
