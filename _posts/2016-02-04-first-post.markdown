Hi!

After taking some time to consider whether or not to embark on this mini-project
and after a bit of persuasion from a colleague of mine here is my first blog
post!

I created this blog to extend my portfolio, write about cool<sup>1</sup> stuff
I'm working on and to have something to look back on as the years go by.
Most of my posts will be tech / software_dev related, but I may go off topic
once in a while. It also allows me to play around with static site generators,
currently I'm using out of the box Jekyll but I'm willing to play around so
expect things to change every once in a while.

<sup>1</sup>heavily subjective
