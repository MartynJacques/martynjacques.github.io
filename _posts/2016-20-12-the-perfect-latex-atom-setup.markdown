Above is a screenshot of my current (perfected) setup I use to write LaTeX documents with. As my dissertation approaches, I thought I'd make the switch from TeXworks to my more familiar and main text editor atom to increase productivity and only have to worry about one editor for all my work.

The packages I used to achieve this are:
- language-latex
- latex, make sure you have latexmk installed correctly
- latex-autocomplete
- latexer
- linter-chktex
- pdfview
- spell-check, this is installed by default but make sure to add 'text.tex.latex' to the grammars list in the package settings
